Spigot plugin that re adds donkey portal dupe from 2017

Here is a video explaining portal dupe-

It also works with llamas probably a update soon where i add a config so you can disable llama or donkey dupe
And yes this is an op dupe it can break your servers economy.
This is also my first spigot plugin, so its not the best way to do it and you should try look for other plugins src if you plan on using the source for your own plugin

You can skid the plugin but link this github or spigot page with it
